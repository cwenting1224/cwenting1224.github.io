Thank you for visiting my website! I am a postdoctoral researcher in Physics at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on topological metamaterials, where I apply the principles of topological physics from electronic systems to phononic systems, including acoustics and mechanical structures. These systems offer a versatile platform for demonstrating the universality and diversity of topological phases, featuring topologically protected edge states. They have practical applications in adiabatic pumping, backscattering-free waveguides, vibration isolation, and enhanced robustness against defects.
